    <p>
        The Doom of Chelchis is a Void-element Scout Rifle that drops from the <strong>King's Fall</strong> 
        raid in Destiny 2. It is a strong Scout Rifle featuring a perk pool that can yield combinations such 
        as <strong>Explosive Payload / Dragonfly</strong>, able to deal high amounts of damage while also 
        creating an elemental explosion upon precision kills. Another interesting perk combination includes 
        <strong>Firefly / Dragonfly</strong> for those Solar subclass Guardians who like to double-dip in 
        precision kill explosions.
